# DigitRecognizer
In this Project we are going to recognize digits 
we have a dataset of digits in images label from 1 to 9
we are using CNN to predict the number 
libraries:
tensorflow
keras
numpy 
pandas
first we prepare the data as per the CNN requirements which is normalizing , reshaping and converting the categorical data
after we prepare our dataset we input it in CNN and go through several Layers
after that we can optimize our model and fit it
at the end we will predict the number
